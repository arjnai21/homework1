What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge creates a new merge commit that contains the changes from both branches. A rebase will take the commit from one branch and push them onto another branch.

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is the place where your code is stored. Your repository should be hosted on a remote server that everyone working on a project can pull to and push from.
